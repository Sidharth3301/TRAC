# TRAC
TRAC- The Radio Astronomy Club is the club dealing with radio astronomy activities at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus

This repo contains the projects I have worked on in a personal capacity at TRAC, for collaborative projects do visit the team's [github page](https://github.com/TRAC-BITS-PILANI)

## Training 2020
- Using a data file containing observations from a radio telescope called ORT in Ooty about the Vela Pulsar, a spectrogram and a frequency distribution for the power and received voltages are pllotted.
## LIGO CNN
- Glitch classification project using CNN from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04596) paper by Michael Zevin et al. using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/tentotheminus9/gravity-spy-gravitational-waves) dataset available publically on Kaggle.

## Paper Implementation of "Matching Matched Filtering"[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06041)
- Took inspiration from Habbard et. al. for using DL techniques to learn to classify time series signals from LIGO detector as belonging to a Gravitational Wave or not
- Currently I have worked on replicating the papers results, will work on improving the same.
